## Research statement

My research examines how macro-level environmental factors—from neighborhood characteristics to social movements to policy environments—influence micro-level developmental processes including stress physiology, cognitive function, and psychological well-being. I apply an interdisciplinary approach to studying social environment and well-being, using mixed methods to examine how factors like resource scarcity and environmental barriers measurably shape health outcomes and divergent life trajectories. This includes spatial analysis of environmental exposures, computational text analysis of expert narratives, longitudinal modeling of biomarker data, and mixed-methods approaches. This methodological diversity allows me to examine social context effects across multiple levels of analysis—from "neurons to neighborhoods". My work is theoretically grounded in ecological systems theory, scarcity theory, skin-deep resilience, social identity theory, John Henryism, and social baseline theory, allostatic load theory, and community-based participatory research approaches to examine questions that matter for scientific understanding, social policy, and marginalized communities.
