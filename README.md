### About Me
I bring a unique blend of expertise in human behavior, health, and quantitative modeling to scholar-activism. At Earlham, I engaged in diverse research experiences, from studying biomolecular interactions in Thailand to investigating cumulative risk in migrant children at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) School of Public Health. My current doctoral research at Cornell University, under the guidance of Dr. Will Hobbs, explores the dynamic interplay between cognitive functioning and scarcity of social, financial, and temporal resources. In collaboration with the Odoms-Young Nutrition Liberation, Food Sovereignty, and Justice Lab, I'm coordinating a Delphi study for a large Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-funded project aimed at building expert consensus on a systems dynamic model of structural racism in the US food system and its impact on childhood obesity. From 2021-2024 I was a Data Science Fellow at the Cornell Center for Social Science (CCSS), developing engaging technical computing workshops and providing consulting support to upskill fellow graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty in quantitative social sciences. Currently, I am preparing my dissertation for a December 2026 expected graduation. 

Fun Fact: I have two senior dogs named Snow and Bruno!
